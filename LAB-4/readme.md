## Lab 4 

1. `Prog1/` Write a program in TCP to establish a connection between a client and a server. 
Display appropriate messages to confirm the connection establishment or error scenario. 
2. `Prog2/` Write a program in TCP to pass a string “Welcome to KIIT” from client to server. 
Display the string in server side. Further, determine the number of vowels in the string and send the same to
the client. The client will display the number of vowels present.
3. `Prog3/` Write a program in TCP to pass a string from client to server. On the server side first display
the string and then check if the string is a palindrome or not.
4. `Prog4/` Write a program in TCP to pass an integer array from client to server. 
Display the array on the server side and then determine the sum of elements of array. 
The server sends back this sum to the client side which will display the same.
5. `Prog5/` Write a program in TCP to pass an integer array from client to server. 
On the server side determine the second largest element of the array and send back that element to the client. 
The client will then display that element.
